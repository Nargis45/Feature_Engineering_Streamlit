                        Standardization (also known as Z-score Normalization) is a technique that transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This process adjusts each feature so that it follows a standard normal distribution (or approximately normal), which is useful for many machine learning algorithms that assume normally distributed data, such as linear regression and logistic regression.

For example, one feature might range from 0 to 1, while another might range from 1,000 to 100,000. If a machine learning model is trained on this data without standardization, the model may give more importance to features with larger numerical ranges simply due to their scale.</p>
